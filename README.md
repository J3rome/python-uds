# Python-UDS
This repository was forked to allow to pass a preinstantiated `python-can` can bus instance instead of creating a new canbus instance

## Original README

An extensible UDS library for python including the diagnostic service definitions from the ISO14229 standard.

Currently supports CAN connections using the [Python-CAN] (https://github.com/hardbyte/python-can) package and a standalone ISO-15765 transport protocol.
